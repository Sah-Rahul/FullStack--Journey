## ðŸ“… Day 7: DOM Manipulation, DOM Events, Local Storage, Form Validation

### ðŸ“š What I Learned Today:

âœ… DOM Manipulation: Selecting elements and updating their style and content.  
âœ… DOM Events: Button clicks, form submissions, window load.  
âœ… Local Storage: Save and retrieve counter value across page reloads.  
âœ… Form Validation: Checked for empty inputs and displayed error messages.

### ðŸ”¥ My Note:
Today I learned how to interact with the web page using DOM, handle user events like clicks and form submissions, and use local storage to save data. I also practiced form validation to make user inputs more reliable. Feeling like a real frontend developer now!
