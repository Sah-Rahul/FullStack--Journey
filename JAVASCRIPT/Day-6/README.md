### ðŸ“š What I Learned Today:

âœ… How to create and use Promises with .then() and .catch().  
âœ… Practiced Promise Chaining to perform multiple async operations.  
âœ… Learned async/await syntax to simplify asynchronous code.  
âœ… Used Fetch API to make GET requests to a public API.  
âœ… Built a mini API project to fetch and display data on the page.

### ðŸ”¥ My Note:
Today I learned how JavaScript handles real asynchronous operations using Promises and async/await. I also practiced making API calls and building a small project to display API data. Super fun and super useful!
